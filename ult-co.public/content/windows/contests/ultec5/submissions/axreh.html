					<p>Comment: First up Axreh harsh song cut, rotation on every cine kinda threw me off, a little old school on the cines, but overall decent edit i like the sequence on 00:40 </p>

					<p>Comment: This is quite good and above average. The first cine uses the generic swoosh sound everyone has heard before, it fits scenes with a lot of quick movement, your cine doesn't really have that. Although, bonus points for the 3D. The concept of the first cine is really cool. The text at the bottom is cool. The song is a bit too quiet here, especially compared to the rest of the video. I had to adjust the audio throughout the edit. The intro sound effects could benefit from a jitter-glitch effect. The loud swooshes filled with bass are not ideal here.</p>
					<p>As for the beat drop, I have a small issue. You used the magic swoosh sound, but it's off-sync. If this was intentional, it feels random. The intro effects are a little too basic, well, they're not really there. I won’t penalize it for that, but adding more to it could have earned you some extra points. The white solid flicker transition at 0:10 doesn’t really fit this part, especially considering the rest of the intro and the song here.</p>
					<p>Now, onto the rest of the edit. The first clip is mostly fine, the impact is there, but the clip itself doesn’t have much going on. The color correction is nice, and the sound works well. However, the velocity on the pump pullout could be better, there aren't enough frames with motion, and the song doesn't feel sharp enough for that. The beat isn’t very impactful, so having a sharp pan crop like that disconnects the video from the music. Everything is fine up until 0:26, though I must admit the helicopter cine would have been much better with some effect in it to visualize the reverb in the song.</p>
					<p>Now, to review my least favorite part of this video, the pink ghoul wipe. First of all, I don't think having so many buildup frames before the shot was a good idea. The song doesn’t have any buildup here, and the guy isn’t even speaking at this point. The transition from cine to clip should feel sharp, especially when syncing with the beat. The shot's sound effects are metallic, which isn’t the right choice here. The mix of your sound effects isn’t great here, the bass of the shot's SFX is too loud, the metal sound ends too abruptly, and everything just sounds forced together instead of flowing naturally. The whole clip feels messy. You added VHS effects just for the sake of it. If it had the style of the helicopter cine, it would have been much better. The clip feels too fast and disconnected from the song. You can’t really feel the sync, it's flashy for no reason. I’m also not a fan of the sync right after the second shot, it could have come a few frames later.</p>
					<p>The green ghoul cines are pretty good, but the purple color feels forced. I have to say it, it seems like you used your own project file effects to make this video quickly. I know this because I do it too. You didn’t spend much time thinking about how to make these effects feel different from your other videos.</p>
					<p>For the third clip, I really wish the first shot had started earlier. If the shot had aligned with the vocals, it would have been better. I also dislike that the cine ends with an S-graph-like velocity. The ending of the last ghoul cine would have been much better if it had simply cut to the clip or if the buildup had started earlier with the vocals. It ended up looking like transition preset #3. I really like the transition at 0:34, though it would have been much better with different colors, like green or yellow, especially if they were brighter and more saturated. Again, though, it looks like you just reused an effect from previous videos without changing much.</p>
					<p>The fourth clip is almost perfect, including the cines before it. However, I wish there had been some effects at 0:38. You could get rid of the blue effect on the right (or also put it on the left and improve it). I like how you split the kill in two parts though, but the 2nd sync could have some effects to make it look less static/instant/awkward. For the transition from the fourth clip to the next cine, I think the movement should have been horizontal instead of vertical. There’s this small glitch effect that wiggles the clip left and right. It's a great idea but the motion of the cinematic ruins it.</p>
					<p>The fifth clip is good, but I don't understand why the second deagle shot sounds like a bomb exploding. It kind of makes me giggle. I also wish the first shot didn’t have the flicker effect. If you removed it, the second shot would feel more unique. I also think the gray invert effect should have ended without a fade. It would have worked better with a glitchier effect and 1 frames.</p>
					<p>I have to mention the pullout-like sound effect in this part. It feels out of place (I checked the song and it's not originally there). It's just a bit odd, that part doesn't have any movement so it feels like it has no purpose. For the third kill, the scar sound effects are good, and the kill impact works fine. However, the red effect feels like it's too much. You could have added some desaturation to emphasize the bass drop in the music. The death cine movement is great, but the following cines could have had more impact. The same goes for the next one. I know it's not your fault, but the deagle reload cine is split into two motions, which triggers me. You could have worked around it or used it to your advantage by syncing it with the song or something. It’s fine, but it makes it look less professional.</p>
					<p>For the clip after this cine, I think the first frames of the deagle shot should have been brighter to better transition from the bright cine. For the death cine at 1:00, you could have made the second white solid less visible to make the third one feel more impactful.</p>
					<p>The ending of the video is great, though. Well, maybe some cinematics have a little too much rotation, but it took me a while to notice. </p>
					Good job, nice basics, unique style, I can easily see who made the edit without checking the channel's name. </p>

					<p>Comment: God this intro is really fucking cool. The second half of this edit was one of the highlights of this bracket for me. The in-game replay stuff was really well done and I am a sucker for well-timed shakes.</p>
					<p>The section from 0:24-0:34 was one of the things that held this back for me. The flow just felt completely uprooted and way too fast without a major musical change to defend it. I would've completely replaced the helicopter wipe clip with a different, much slower paced wipe. It just feels extremely disjointed compared to everything else being much slower. </p>
					<p>I really like moments like the waveform at the side at 0:41, and of course the intro. Leaning more into that white and blue, sleek, futuristic look I think could've brought out some really cool moments. </p>
					<p>Overall I really enjoyed most of this, but I feel like a little more time and care into the middle section would've benefitted this majorly. 83/100 </p>

					<p>Comment: Opening cinematics are awesome, the style of this edit feels very focused and nothing feels too out of place. I think the way the edit speeds up and slows down at different parts is very cool and all the ideas in this video expressed in this video are pulled off in a very satisfying way.</p>

<p>The end of the edit kind of throws me off a with the location of the clip and cines being in a temple which kind of clashes with the simplicity of everything else. I also do think while this edit had lots of creative ideas, it doesn't do too much to stand out and should have tapped more into ideas similar to the opening cinematics. </p>
