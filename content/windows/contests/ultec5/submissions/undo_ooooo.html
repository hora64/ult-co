					<p>Comment: insane creativity and atmosphere. only reason its not a 100 is because some transitions feel too fast which makes them look weird. </p>

					<p>Comment: I mean its undo, need I say more... Nah fr tho this is an insanely trippy video and something very freshening to see compared to the standard cod edit, I love the creativity. However I do feel like this video also lacks an overall purpose and progression, it doesn't really go anywhere or really speak to me in anyway apart from it being overly technical. If undo partnered up with someone who could tell a story and put his technical aspect to that then that would be something unbelievable I think would blow the editing cod com out the water. </p>

					<p>Comment: Pretty much a perfect edit ngl lol everything was executed really well and the camera movement was super fluid and dynamic as it moved throughout each world. Small nitpick but not that major tbh, at 1:14 that character standing completely still throws it off for me a bit. </p>
